First and foremost, all project requirements have been successfully implemented. To accomplish this, I utilized `TypeScript, ReactJS, Tailwind, and Axios`.

`TypeScript` was employed to proactively catch and prevent common programming errors, ensuring easy maintenance as the project evolves.

For styling, I chose `Tailwind` for its swift and efficient styling capabilities. However, I typically lean towards `MaterialUI`, especially when it provides ready-made components and easy customization through a design system. If no design system is available, I resort to Tailwind or plain CSS.

`Axios` was selected for handling requests due to its user-friendly nature. While it could be replaced with the built-in `fetch` function, I opted for Axios to minimize code and enhance readability.

Furthermore, please note that the project currently lacks support for mobile devices, as there is no completed design specifically tailored for smaller screens. Additionally, in development mode, the "user" query parameter may appear twice due to React's strict mode. While this does not affect the expected functionality, it can be easily resolved by tracking renders within a `useEffect`. However, for the current development version, I have chosen to leave it as is.
